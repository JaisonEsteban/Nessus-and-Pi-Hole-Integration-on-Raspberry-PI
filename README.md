# Nessus and Pi-hole Combined Security Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to combine [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) and [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/) to create a dual-layer network security setup. Pi-hole blocks ads and malicious domains at the DNS level, while Nessus scans the network for vulnerabilities. Together, they improve the overall security posture of your home or small office network.

## Features
- **Pi-hole DNS Filtering**: Blocks ads and malicious domains.
- **Nessus Vulnerability Scanning**: Scans the network for known vulnerabilities.
- **Network Diagram**: Visual representation of how Nessus and Pi-hole interact in your network.

## Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi (or any Linux system)
- Debian-based OS (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS)
- Pi-hole installed
- Nessus installed (free or pro version)

## Setup Instructions
1. **Pi-hole Installation**:
    - Follow the [Pi-hole installation guide](Docs/installation.md) to set up Pi-hole on your Raspberry Pi.
    - Configure Pi-hole to filter DNS queries for your network.

2. **Nessus Installation**:
    - Install Nessus by following the [Nessus installation guide](Docs/installation.md).
    - Configure Nessus to scan your network as described in [configuration.md](Docs/configuration.md).

3. **Connect Nessus with Pi-hole**:
    - Configure Nessus to use Pi-hole as its DNS server for vulnerability scanning.
    - Refer to the [usage guide](Docs/usage.md) for more details.

## Usage
Once setup is complete, use Nessus to scan your network while Pi-hole filters out malicious DNS requests. Review the reports generated by both tools to monitor your network's security.
